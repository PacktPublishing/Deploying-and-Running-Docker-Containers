# Deploying and Running Docker Containers [Video]
This is the code repository for [Deploying and Running Docker Containers [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/deploying-and-running-docker-containers-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788625777), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Docker is a portable container format that allows you to run code anywhere from your desktop to the cloud. Docker's workflow makes development, testing, and deployment much easier and much faster. This video course will walk you through a basic deployment-pipeline setup in Jenkins. You will then learn how to create two minimal Docker environments: one for development and one for production. You will then set up Jenkins inside a Docker container to support and automate your deployment pipeline. Next, you will learn how to provide reliability and scalability to your application by setting up a cluster of Docker hosts using Docker's Swarm mode, and then automate the deployment of Docker hosts using Chef. Finally, you will monitor, log, and manage your Docker containers. Towards the end of this video course, you will work with the various components required to run Docker in production.
